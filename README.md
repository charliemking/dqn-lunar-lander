# Lunar Lander with Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) using PyTorch to train an agent to solve the `LunarLander-v3` environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent learns to land a spacecraft safely by interacting with the environment and approximating value functions through a neural network.

Key reinforcement learning techniques used include epsilon-greedy exploration, experience replay, and a target network. Over 1000+ training episodes, the agent consistently learned to land successfully.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with deep reinforcement learning and a stronger understanding of how neural networks can approximate value functions in sequential decision-making tasks.
