In this project, I built a Deep Q-Network using PyTorch to train an agent to solve the LunarLander-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym. I implemented key reinforcement learning techniques including epsilon-greedy exploration, experience replay, and a target network. Over 1000+ training episodes, the agent learned to land the spacecraft successfully. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with deep reinforcement learning and a stronger understanding of how neural networks can be used to approximate value functions in dynamic environments.
